Further development:
The program can be further developed with, among other things, authentication technology so that users can verify themselves using an email address.
Patterns can be used to recognize weak passwords and warn the user or require stronger passwords.
Both the program and the database can also be developed so that the user can send Emojies, images and media files to make the chat more pleasant.
Even the user interface can be further developed by adding icons and symbols to make it more appealing.
